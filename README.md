This app leverages multiple geolocation services to provide location-based functionalities like tracking mobile details, calculating distances, mapping routes, and more. It is a useful tool for users who want to interactively obtain location coordinates, track routes, calculate distances, and find details of any mobile numberâ€™s carrier and region.

# Features
Get Current Location: Display current location coordinates (latitude and longitude) using IP data.
Map Routes Between Two Locations: Plot and display a route between two input locations (driving or walking) on an interactive map.
Distance Calculator: Calculate the geographical distance between two input locations.
Phone Number Tracker: Track details of a mobile number, including carrier information, country, and region, along with mapping the location on an interactive map.
Voice Assistance: Each service is enhanced with voice feedback to guide users through each option and provide results.
